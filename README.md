# Extracting Meaningful Information: from Rate Distortion Theory to the Information Bottleneck Method

This repository contains a research project I made for the course "TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING: FROM INFORMATION THEORY TO EVOLUTIONARY MODELS" as well as the slides I used to present it in class. The main references are the following papers:
